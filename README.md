# RedstoneServer

This is the server of a self-hosted CLI backup tool for my final graduation project.

WIP...

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
